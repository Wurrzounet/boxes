Giving Something Back
=====================

Boxes.py started as a one person, in the spare time project
and it mostly still is. I started it to have fun and with the hope
it will be useful for myself and others. But I understand when people
feel funny using it for free when similar drawings are sold elsewhere
for a few bucks each - in fixed sizes and thickness.

Open Source / Free Software Community
-------------------------------------

I strongly belief in Open Source / Free Software values. Boxes.py is
my way of giving back to the community. I use Free Software every
day. If you participate in an Open Source projects in your own time
please enjoy!

Contribute
----------

Another way to give back is contributing to the project itself. This
does not need to mean contributing code. There also is a need for
pictures, descriptions, assembly instructions, documentation, translations
and much more. See :ref:`contributing` for details.

Spread the Word
---------------

I also belief one of the main goals of Open Source is to maximize the
value and usefulness of software and the work that went into it. So
telling others about Boxes.py, giving a talk at your local hacker
space, publishing a video, or just posting about your project is just as valuable as participating to
the project directly.

Donate Money
------------

I understand that for many just sending a few bucks over as a token of
appreciation is easier than getting involved. If you want to do
that, you can support my hacker space `Backspace in Bamberg Germany
<https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Backspace>`_ (`German web site
<http://hackerspace-bamberg.de/>`_).  Without its support (and laser
cutter) the development of Boxes.py would not have been possible. It
also hosts the web instance nowadays.

You can donate money via `PayPal
<https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=finanzen%40hackerspace-bamberg.de&lc=DE&item_name=backspace%20e.%20V.&amp;item_number=Boxes.py&no_note=0&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP-DonationsBF:btn_donate_LG.gif:NonHostedGuest>`_. If you don't have an account, credit or debit card also works there.
